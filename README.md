# Cinnamon Desktop On Github Codespace
This setup installs an Ubuntu 24.04 container with the Cinnamon desktop environment and configures KasmVNC for remote browser-based access.

Running a desktop environment in Codespaces is generally permitted, as Microsoft themselves provide documentation for setting up a Fluxbox-based desktop with a browser: https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite. In this case, we’ll be using Cinnamon instead. You don’t need to worry about account issues as long as you use the service responsibly and stay within GitHub’s Terms of Service.

# How to use
1. Create a new space: https://github.com/codespaces/new
2. Select this repo `AndnixSH/codespace-desktop`
3. Select a machine type. To unlock better machine types, file a ticket to Github: https://support.github.com/contact?tags=rr-codespaces%2Ccat_codespace
4. Click "Create codespace". It will take a while to create
5. Once created, a browser tab should automatically open to the forwarded port `8444`. Alternatively, you can open the **PORTS** tab and open the forwarded address for port `8444`.
6. When prompted by your browser's Basic Authentication dialog, enter:
   - **Username**: `qwerty`
   - **Password**: `qwerty`

The default keyboard layout is English (US). You can change it in Cinnamon settings.

To run Windows apps, install Wine: https://wiki.winehq.org/Ubuntu

# Limitations & bugs
- No hardware acceleration because Codespace does not have a GPU
- Terminal won't open. Use Xfce Terminal or others instead
